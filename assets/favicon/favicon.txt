Set border to clear and fill to white.
To make the star icon, don't use the pen or curve tools.
Instead, use the star tool.
Set it to 4 a pointed star.
I made the outer radius 25 and the inner radius 10.
Scale horizontally with the selection tool to make the star longer than it is 
wide.
Circles for curving the inner corners should appear across from each corner.
Drag these circles to your liking.
Use the direct selection tool to select the newly created anchor points closest 
to the horizontal axis from the smooth out operation.
Transform these anchors by scaling by 80% along the y-axis.
It will create excess paths, the final path in your layer should be the final
path.
