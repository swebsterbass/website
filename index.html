		<!--jQuery

			jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree 
			traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS 
			animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the 
			permissive MIT License. As of Aug 2022, jQuery is used by 77% of the
			10 million most popular websites. Web analysis indicates that it is 
			the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, 
			having at least 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript 
			library
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery

			there are several ways to start using jQuery on your website:
			1. download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
			2. include jQuery from a CDN (content delivery network), like Google
